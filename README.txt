Automatic genre classification
An attempt to automatic genre classification using machine learning approaches.

> "Silla2008_Article_AMachineLearningApproachToAuto.pdf" is our research paper.
> Files starting with 'music' are algorithms we tried for our dataset... eg: musicNN.py is NeuralNet
> 'labels.csv' and 'sample-data.csv' are our data..
> Others , namely:
  > sample-analysis.py (digital signal proccessing)
  > neuralnet.py (simple manual neural net)
  > audio.py (analyse using librosa)
  > Violin-Theme-MassTamilan.wav (used as sample for exploration) :  we tried these to analyse and explore about the decomposition of audio that is mentioned in the paper.

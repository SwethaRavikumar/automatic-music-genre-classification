# **Automatic genre classification**
An attempt to automatic genre classification using machine learning approaches. 

> "Silla2008_Article_AMachineLearningApproachToAuto.pdf" is our research paper.  
> Files starting with 'music' are algorithms we tried for our dataset...
> Others , namely:
  1. sample-analysis.py (digital signal proccessing)
  2. neuralnet.py (simple manual neural net)
  3. audio.py (analyse using librosa)
  4. Violin-Theme-MassTamilan.wav (used as sample for exploration)
: we tried these to analyse and explore about the decomposition of audio that is mentioned in the paper.
